    <h1>Nature</h1>
    <h2>About The Nature</h2>
    <p>Nature is an inherent character or constitution,particularly of the ecosphere or the universe as a whole. In this general sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena of the physical world, including life. Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole are often described as at times at odds, or outright separate and even superior to nature.
